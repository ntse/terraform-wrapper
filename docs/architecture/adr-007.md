## ADR-007: Environment-Aware Backend Configuration

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-14

### Context

Different environments (dev, uat, prod) required separate Terraform state paths and variable sets.

### Decision

Backend keys and state paths follow a consistent convention:

```
bucket = "<account>-<region>-terraform-state"
key    = "<env>/<stack>/terraform.tfstate"
```

Each environment loads its own .tfvars file and backend config dynamically via tfexec.BackendConfig(...).

### Consequences

Automatic backend isolation per environment.
Uniform naming convention across all stacks.
Enables parallel execution of different environments safely.
