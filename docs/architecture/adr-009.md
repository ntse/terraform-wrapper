## ADR-009: Reinvent Terragrunt

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-14

### Context

We need a way to orchestrate our Terraform stacks. So far we have tried a mixture of Python and Github Actions to do so but have discovered that YAML is not a programming language, no matter how much we abuse the `if`, `matrix` and `needs` clauses.

Terragrunt already provides dependency management, remote backend configuration, DRY variable inheritance, and orchestrated apply-all/plan-all functionality for Terraform but adopting this would require reading its documentation pages. Of which there are many.

### Decision

We will reinvent Terragrunt, in Go, from scratch.

This new orchestrator will a more basic version of Terragrunt that will be worse in almost every way.

### Alternatives Considered

Use Terragrunt:

- Mature, proven and actively maintained.
- Backed by a strong, active community.

Wrap Terraform with Bash:

- No, letâ€™s not. Not even as a joke.

### Consequences

- We get an orchestration tool that fits exactly how we structure and think about Terraform.
- We gain deep control over execution flow, parallelism, and state management.
- We now responsible for owning and maintaining a Terraform orchestration engine.
