## ADR-001: Adopt Multi-Stack Terraform Orchestration Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-14

### Context

We manage a large Terraform monorepo containing multiple independent but interdependent stacks (e.g., core-services/network, applications/frontend, etc.).
Manually applying them in dependency order is slow and error-prone, especially across environments (dev, uat, prod).

### Decision

We built a Go-based Terraform orchestration wrapper that:

Treats each stack as an isolated Terraform working directory.

Discovers dependencies via dependencies.json.

Builds a dependency graph and executes stacks in topological order.

Uses terraform-exec for native command invocation.

###  Consequences

Simplified orchestration — single command for full-environment deploys.
Supports per-stack isolation and blast-radius reduction.
Introduces additional complexity (custom tooling must stay updated with Terraform releases).
Requires CI/CD pipelines to be aware of orchestration semantics (e.g., “plan-all”, “apply-all”).
