## ADR-008: Implementation Language

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-14

### Context

The wrapper began life as a Python script because it was fast to prototype and easy to run inside CI. As the orchestration layer matured, the scope expanded to include dependency graphing, remote backend bootstrapping, parallel execution, and integration with Terraform internals. Shelling out to the Terraform CLI became increasingly brittle, especially when we needed to handle streaming output, workspace locks, and binary management.

### Decision

Adopt Go (Golang) as the implementation language for the orchestration wrapper.

Key benefits:

- Direct access to Terraform libraries such as `terraform-exec`, `hc-install`, `terraform-json`, and `hcl/v2`.
- A built-in concurrency model suited to orchestrating many stacks with shared dependencies.
- Static binaries that are easy to distribute to developers and CI workers without Python runtimes.

### Rationale

- The HashiCorp toolchain is primarily written in Go, so bindings are first-class and well maintained.
- Embedding Terraform via `terraform-exec` keeps behaviour identical to the CLI while avoiding brittle process orchestration.
- Goâ€™s standard tooling (`go test`, `go build`) integrates cleanly with our desired CI pipelines.

### Alternatives Considered

- Python: fast iteration and a familiar stack, but requires subprocess orchestration, suffers from dependency sprawl, and complicates static distribution.
- Rust: attractive runtime guarantees, yet the Terraform ecosystem lacks native libraries, which would force custom bindings.

### Consequences

- Contributors need Go experience, which can slow onboarding for engineers from scripting backgrounds.
- Module dependencies must track Terraform releases to retain compatibility.
- We gain consistent, cross-platform builds and better performance for concurrent orchestration.
